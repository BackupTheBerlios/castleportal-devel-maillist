Hello
There are a bug with the users and groups management. One user can't be
member of various groups. The problems is in the model Groups.cs in the
property Users caused by The (Cascade = ManyRelationCascadeEnum.SaveUpdate).
Other question. Why in Groups and Models use ISet? Why is better than IList?
Maybe ISet cause also the previous problem.

And finally, i can't download the svn. I do this
svn checkout
svn+ssh://hector at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/castleportal/trunk

request me the password, i write it, but request again the password and
don't download anything
The password is correct. I can login in berlios without problems. Anybody
know that happen?


Thank

Hi!
         I can't reproduce the problem, since I really can add an user  
to several
         groups. ISet is actually the right way for the relationship  
among users
         and groups, because the user/group must'n be repeated along the list.
         Berlios svn sometimes fails so it shows you an "invalid password"
         message as you try to check out the svn. Try again for a few times, it
         should work. I think that they have some bandwith problems.
         I have no so good internet connection these days, sorry for any
         inconvenience.
         Good luck.
